h2#title The Quartz Industry Tracker

p The United States has collected detailed statistics on the types and sizes of American businesses since the 1930's (TKTK). Due to frequent changes in how businesses are categorized, much of this data is difficult to compare. However, a subset of industries can be directly compared going back to the 1980's or even further. Quartz has crunched the numbers to create this comprehensive browser of all the comparable data for American industries.
